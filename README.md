# Facial Expression Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
This repository contains jupyter notebook that includes facial expression classifier models for Kaggle's facial emotion expressions dataset

To run the Jupyter Notebook, follow the below steps:

	Step 1: Download the Notebook - Image_Classification_Assignment1_Harshitha.ipynb.
	Step 2: Open the same in Google Colab or Jupyter in your local system.
	Step 3: Download Kaggle's facial emotion expressions open dataset from the below link 			
	Step 4: After downloading the dataset, upload the same in your Google drive if you are using Google Colab.
	Step 5: You can include from local directory if using jupyter notebook.
	Step 6: Observe the code and perform the steps in each cell to get the desired result.
	Step 7: Feel free to improve the model.
